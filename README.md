# Shopping Cart API Test Suite

This is a small project written in **C#** that tests the functionality of a shopping cart API using **MSTest**. The base project provides a few core endpoints, and two new endpoints were implemented and tested as part of this task.

## Project Structure

- Language: C#
- Test Framework: MSTest
- IDE Used: Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

## Existing Endpoints

These endpoints were already provided and tested:

- `GET /store/items` — Returns a list of available items in the store.
- `POST /cart/add` — Adds a specific item to the cart.
- `POST /order/complete` — Completes the order by clearing all items in the cart.

## Added Endpoints

Two new endpoints were added and tested:

- `GET /cart/items` — Returns a list of items currently in the cart.
- `POST /cart/remove` — Removes a specific item from the cart.

## Running the Tests

To run all tests:

1. Open a terminal in the `ShoppingCartTests` directory.
2. Run the following command:

```bash
dotnet test

NOte that tests can be included or excluded based on categories

dotnet test --filter "TestCategory!=Basic"
dotnet test --filter "TestCategory!=Scenario"

a simple report can be generated by

dotnet test --logger "trx"
```
